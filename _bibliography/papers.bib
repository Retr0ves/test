abstract = {Alibaba's 2021 and 2022 microservice datasets are the only publicly
  available sources of request-workflow traces from a large-scale
  microservice deployment.  They have the potential to strongly
  influence future research as they provide much-needed visibility
  into industrial microservices' characteristics.  We conduct the first
  systematic analyses of both datasets to help facilitate their use by
  the community.  We find that the 2021 dataset contain numerous
  inconsistencies preventing reconstruction of full trace topologies.
  The 2022 dataset also suffers from inconsistencies, but at a much
  lower rate.  Tools that strictly follow Alibaba's specs for
  constructing traces from these datasets will silently ignore these
  inconsistencies, misinforming researchers by creating traces of the
  wrong sizes and shapes.  We present \casper{}, a construction method
  that uses redundancies in the datasets to sidestep the
  inconsistencies.  We show that constructing traces using \casper{}
  results in different trace characteristics than other less-informed
  methods. }

abstract = {The microservice architecture is a novel paradigm for building and operating distributed applications in many organizations. This paradigm changes many aspects of how distributed applications are built, managed, and operated in contrast to monolithic applications. It introduces new challenges to solve and requires changing assumptions about previously well-known ones. But, today, the characteristics of large-scale microservice architectures are invisible outside their organizations, depressing opportunities for research. Recent studies provide only partial glimpses and represent only single design points. This paper enriches our understanding of large-scale microservices by characterizing Meta’s microservice architecture. It focuses on previously unreported (or underreported) aspects important to developing and researching tools that use the microservice topology or traces of request workflows. We find that the topology is extremely heterogeneous, is in constant flux, and includes software entities that do not cleanly fit in the microservice architecture. Request work- flows are highly dynamic, but local properties can be predicted using service and endpoint names. We quantify the impact of obfuscating factors in microservice measurement and conclude with implications for tools and future-work opportunities.},

abstract = {Industrial microservice architectures vary so wildly in their characteristics, such as size or communication method, that comparing systems is difficult and often leads to confusion and misinterpretation. In contrast, the academic testbeds used to conduct microservices research employ a very constrained set of design choices. This lack of systemization in these key design choices when developing microservice architectures has led to uncertainty over how to use experiments from testbeds to inform practical deployments and indeed whether this should be done at all. We conduct semi-structured interviews with industry participants to understand the representativeness of existing testbeds' design choices. Surprising results included the presence of cycles in industry deployments, as well as a lack of clarity about the presence of hierarchies. We then systematize the possible design choices we learned about from the interviews, and identify important mismatches between our interview results and testbeds' designs that will inform future, more representative testbeds.},

This rigidity has made it incredibly difficult to widely deploy critical fixes to BGP. It has also depressed ASes’; ability to sell value-added services or replace BGP entirely with a more sophisticated protocol. Even if operators undertook the significant effort needed to fix or replace BGP, it is likely the next protocol will be just as difficult to change or evolve. To help, this paper identifies two features needed in the routing infrastructure (i.e., within any inter-domain routing protocol) to facilitate evolution to new protocols. To understand their utility, it presents D-BGP, a version of BGP that incorporates them.},

abstract = {Diagnosing performance problems in modern datacenters and distributed systems is challenging, as the root cause could be contained in any one of the system’s numerous components or, worse, could be a result of interactions among them. As distributed systems continue to increase in complexity, di- agnosis tasks will only become more challenging. There is a need for a new class of diagnosis techniques capable of helping developers address problems in these distributed environments.As a step toward satisfying this need, this dissertation proposes a novel technique, called request-flow comparison, for automatically localizing the sources of performance changes from the myriad potential culprits in a distributed system to just a few potential ones. Request-flow comparison works by contrasting the workflow of how individual requests are serviced within and among every component of the distributed system between two periods: a non-problem period and a problem period. By identifying and ranking performance-affecting changes, request-flow comparison provides developers with promising starting points for their diagnosis efforts. Request workflows are obtained with less than 1\% overhead via use of recently developed end-to-end tracing techniques.  To demonstrate the utility of request-flow comparison in various distributed systems, this dissertation describes its implementation in a tool called Spectroscope and describes how Spectroscope was used to diagnose real, previously unsolved problems in the Ursa Minor distributed storage service and in select Google services. It also explores request-flow comparison’s applicability to the Hadoop File System. Via a 26-person user study, it identifies effective visualiza- tions for presenting request-flow comparison’s results and further demonstrates that request-flow comparison helps developers quickly identify starting points for diagnosis. This dissertation also distills design choices that will maximize an end-to-end tracing infrastructure’s utility for diagnosis tasks and other use cases.},

This paper describes and evaluates three approaches for visualizing the results of a proven technique called “request-flow comparison” for identifying likely causes of performance decreases in a distributed system. Our user study provides a number of insights useful in guiding visualization tool design for distributed system diagnosis. For example, we find that both an overlay-based approach (e.g., diff) and a side-by-side approach are effective, with tradeoffs for different users (e.g., expert vs. not) and different problem types. We also find that an animation-based approach is confusing and difficult to use.},

Using Spectroscope, developers can visualize and compare system behaviours between two periods or system versions, identifying and ranking various changes in the flow or timing of request processing. Examples of how Spectroscope has been used to diagnose real performance problems seen in a distributed storage system are presented, and Spectroscope’s primary assumptions and algorithms are evaluated.},

abstract = {The causes of performance changes in a distributed system often elude even its developers. This paper develops a new technique for gaining insight into such changes: comparing system behaviours from two executions (e.g., of two system versions or time periods). Building on end-to-end request flow tracing within and across components, algorithms are described for identifying and ranking changes in the flow and/or timing of request processing. The implementation of these algorithms in a tool called Spectroscope is described and evaluated. Five case studies are presented of using Spectroscope to diagnose performance changes in a distributed storage system caused by code changes and configuration modifications, demonstrating the value and efficacy of comparing system behaviours.},

abstract = {Relative fitness is a new black-box approach to modeling the performance of storage devices. In contrast with an absolute model that predicts the performance of a workload on a given storage device, a relative fitness model predicts per- formance differences between a pair of devices. There are two primary advantages to this approach. First, because a relative fitness model is constructed for a device pair, the application-device feedback of a closed workload can be cap- tured (e.g., how the I/O arrival rate changes as the workload moves from device A to device B). Second, a relative fitness model allows performance and resource utilization to be used in place of workload characteristics. This is beneficial when workload characteristics are difficult to obtain or concisely express (e.g., rather than describe the spatio-temporal char- acteristics of a workload, one could use the observed cache behavior of device A to help predict the performance of B).This paper describes the steps necessary to build a relative fitness model, with an approach that is general enough to be used with any black-box modeling technique. We compare relative fitness models and absolute models across a vari- ety of workloads and storage devices. On average, relative fitness models predict bandwidth and throughput within 10– 20\% and can reduce prediction error by as much as a factor of two when compared to absolute models.},

abstract = {Making request flow tracing an integral part of soft- ware systems creates the potential to better understand their operation. The resulting traces can be converted to per- request graphs of the work performed by a service, repre- senting the flow and timing of each request’s processing. Collectively, these graphs contain detailed and comprehen- sive data about the system’s behavior and the workload that induced it, leaving the challenge of extracting insights. Categorizing and differencing such graphs should greatly improve our ability to understand the runtime behavior of complex distributed services and diagnose problems. Clus- tering the set of graphs can identify common request pro- cessing paths and expose outliers. Moreover, clustering two sets of graphs can expose differences between the two; for example, a programmer could diagnose a problem that arises by comparing current request processing with that of an earlier non-problem period and focusing on the aspects that change. Such categorizing and differencing of system behavior can be a big step in the direction of automated problem diagnosis.},

This paper discusses our early experiences with one specific aspect of storage management: performance tuning and projection. Ursa Minor uses self-monitoring and rudimentary system modeling to support analysis of how system changes would affect performance, exposing simple What.if query interfaces to administrators and tuning agents. We find that most performance predictions are sufficiently accurate (within 10-20\%) and that the associated performance overhead is less than 6\%. Such embedded support for What.if queries simplifies tuning automation and reduces the administrator expertise needed to make acquisition decisions.},

Server-driven metadata prefetching consists of having the metadata server provide information and capabilities for multiple objects, rather than just one, in response to each lookup. Doing so allows clients to access the contents of many small files for each metadata server interaction, reducing access latency and metadata server load. Namespace flattening encodes the directory hierarchy into object IDs such that namespace locality translates to object ID similarity. Doing so exposes namespace relationships among objects (e.g., as hints to storage devices), improves locality in metadata indices, and enables use of ranges for exploiting them. Trace-driven simulations and experiments with a prototype implementation show significant performance benefits for small file workloads.},

abstract = {Distributed file systems that scale by partitioning files and directories among a collection of servers inevitably encounter cross- server operations. A common exampleis a REN ME that moves afile from a directorymanaged by oneserver to a directory managed by another. Systems that provide the same semantics for cross-server operations as for those that do not span servers traditionally implement dedicated protocols for these rare operations. This paper suggests an alternate approach that exploits the existence of dynamic redistribution functionality (e.g., for load balancing, incorporation of new servers, and so on). When a client request would involve files on multiple servers, the system can redistribute those files onto one server and have it service the request. Although such redistribution is more expensive than a dedicated cross-server protocol, the rareness of such operations makes the overall performance impact minimal. Analysis of NFS traces indicates that cross-server operations make up fewer than 0.001\% of client requests, and experiments with a prototype implementation show that the performance impact is negligible when such operations make up as much as 0.01\% of operations. Thus, when dynamic redistribution functionality exists in the system, cross-server operations can be handled with little additional implementation complexity. },

A policy that replicates read-only portions of read-mostly files, however, implicitly coordinates with client cache invalidations and thereby allows almost all read operations to be offloaded. In a read-heavy trace, 75\% of all operations and 52\% of all data transfers can be offloaded.},

abstract = {This technical report contains six final project reports contributed by participants in CMU’s Spring 2005 Advanced Operating Systems and Distributed Systems course (15-712) offered by professor Garth Gibson. This course examines the design and analysis of various aspects of operating systems and distributed systems through a series of background lectures, paper readings, and group projects. Projects were done in groups of two or three, required some kind of implementation and evalution pertaining to the classrom material, but with the topic of these projects left up to each group. Final reports were held to the standard of a systems conference paper submission; a standard well met by the majority of completed projects. Some of the projects will be extended for future submissions to major system conferences.
The reports that follow cover a broad range of topics. These reports present a characterization of synchronization behavior and overhead in commercial databases, and a hardware-based lock predictor based on the characterization; design and implementation of a partitioned protocol offload architecture that provides Direct Data Placement (DDP) functionality and better utilizes both the network interface and the host CPU; design and implementation of file indexing inside file systems for fast content searching support; comparison-based server verification techniques for stateful and semi-deterministic protocols such as NFSv4; data-plane protection techniques for link-state routing protocols such as OSPF, which is resilient to the existence of compromised routers; and performance comparison of in-band and out-of-band data access strategies in file systems.
While not all of these reports report definitely and positively, all are worth reading because they involve novelty in the systems explored and bring forth interesting research questions.},
